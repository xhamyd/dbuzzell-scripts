# dbuzzell-scripts

_dbuzzell-scripts_ is my public repo that holds all of my personally useful scripts. These scripts are shared freely for
use if helpful for others (only attributions/credits requested). However, these scripts have only been lightly validated
for my personal applications, so use these scripts at your own risk.

## Table of Contents

This textual listing is provided for quick reference, and may be out-of-date at any time.

### chroot/

These files were personally edited Bash scripts that I used to personalize my
[chroot](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) files. While I no longer use a Chromebook/Chrome OS environment, there's
some good Bash scripting that may be useful to reference.

### csv_filesort/

This was a proof-of-concept project to sort a bunch of CSV files in nested directories. As a PoC, this script has only
been tested with the provided `test_dir/`. I would not recommended running this on actual CSVs full of data without your
own testing and backups!

### pylint-research/

This is an unsorted collection of my notes when researching all of the errors flagged by pylint. This was run on version
1.9, but the provided script should be able to provide the messages for your installed pylint package.

### tutorial-materials/

While I was learning functionalities in Bash/Python/etc., I kept a local copy of each file used to demonstrate the
feature. These files should be used as a quick reference (instead of direct importing or the like).
